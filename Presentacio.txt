#THE TENDENCE OF THIS GRAPHIC SEEMS TO BE INCREASING, 
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS 
MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING NEAR THE COAST
AND THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN OVER TIME. 
ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN COMMUNICATION AND RECORD-KEEPING MAY HAVELED 
TO MORE ATTACKS BEING REPORTED IN RECENT DECADES COMPARED TO EARLIER ONES.
